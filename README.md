# pybatchvir
GIMP python scripts to batch process images of leaves to aid plant breeders in assessing chlorotic area as a percentage of leaf area.

The purpose of these scripts is to automate the processing of images (samples) in plant breeding or phytopathology programs.
They were created after realizing that doing this stuff by hand is tedious and inefficient for production use.  We (Claudia and Karl) were doing a video on methods (using image processing in the GIMP) to calculate percentage of viral infected tissue in plants.  We came up with two generalized methods, though there may be better ways.  

## Stuff you still have to do manually for both methods:

### 1. Take adequate images:
It's best if each picture is taken by sandwiching the leaf between a red background (or something that makes good contrast) and a transparent material, such as plastic, glass or plexiglass.  The lighting over the entire surface of the leaf must be even. 
### 2. Make sure all the leaves are of the same species.
Since these scripts work by folder, just keep each set in its own folder. :)
